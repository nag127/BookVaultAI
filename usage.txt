# How to Use BookVaultAI

This guide will walk you through the setup and usage of the BookVaultAI application, a Flask-based web app designed to process PDF books, generate summaries, and answer questions using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher is recommended).

2. **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an OpenAI API key to access GPT-4 functionalities. Replace the placeholder `openai_api_key` in the `llm_config.py` file with your actual API key.

## Installation

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the BookVaultAI codebase to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd BookVaultAI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install Flask PyPDF2 openai chromadb
```

### Step 3: Configure the Application

1. **OpenAI API Key**: In the `config/llm_config.py` file, replace the `openai_api_key` with your actual API key:
   ```python
   openai_api_key = "your_actual_openai_api_key"
   ```

2. **ChromaDB Setup**: Ensure you have a working installation of ChromaDB for vector storage and querying. This is handled by the `chromadb` Python package included in the installation.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Application**: Execute the following command in your terminal while inside the BookVaultAI directory:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the BookVaultAI interface.

## Using the Application

### Upload a PDF Book

1. **Upload**: Use the "Upload a PDF book" section to select and upload a PDF file from your computer.
2. **Process**: Click "Upload & Process" to process the PDF. The application will extract text, chunk it, and store it in the vector database.

### View Book Summary

- After processing, a summary of the book will be displayed in the "Book Summary" section.

### Ask Questions

1. **Question Section**: Enter your question in the provided input field under "Ask questions about the book" and click "Ask".
2. **Get Answers**: The application will analyze the book content and provide an answer based on the processed data.

3. **Add New Questions**: Additional question blocks will appear after each question is answered, allowing you to ask multiple questions.
